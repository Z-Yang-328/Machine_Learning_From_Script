# Machine learning algorithms from script

In this repository, I implemented multiple machine learning algorithms from script. The purpose of this repository is help me to understand the algorithms and to help people who read my blog to learn algorithms.
The language used to implement the algorithms is Python. I tried to use as few packages as possible in order to write the most detailed code. The codes can easily be applied to other problems with just a few adjustments.

Final point, also the most important one, is that Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course is the inspiration for this repository. The course is the best ever machine learning course which covers almost everything you should know about machine learning -- Lineaer Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Feature Scaling, SVM, Neural Network, k-Means, Anomaly Detection, etc. If you don't know much about machine learning, this course must be your best choice.
