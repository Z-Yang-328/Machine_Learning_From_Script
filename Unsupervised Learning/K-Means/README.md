### In this folder, we implemented K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch

* main.py - the main function of implementing K-Means.
* findClosestCentorids.py - compute the distance between each data points and each centroid, then find out the closest one.
* computeCentroids.py - compute centroids based on means of data points in each clusters.
* runKmeans.py - run K-Means clustering, and visualize each step.
* plotDataProgress.py - visualizing the process of K-Means clustering.
* plotDataPoints.py - plot original data
* drawLine.py - plot the line between previous centrois and current centorids, to see the centroid-updating process
