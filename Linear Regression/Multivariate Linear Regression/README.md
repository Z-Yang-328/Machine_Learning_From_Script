### Multivariate Linear Regression

* computeCostMulti.py -- compute cost function
* gradientDescentMulti.py -- compute gradient descent and update theta
* featureNormalize.py -- normalize feature (with mean = 0 and std = 1)
* normalEquation.py -- implement normal equation, using normal equation to find theta rather than gradient descent
